# VTI

ðŸš§This feature is not stable yet.ðŸš§

VTI (Vetur Terminal Interface) is a CLI that exposes some of Vetur's features.

## Usage

```bash
npm i -g vti
# run this in the root of a Vue project
vti
vti diagnostics
```

Currently, this is only used for generating interpolation type-checking errors on CLI, which
neither Vue's compiler nor Webpack would catch.
